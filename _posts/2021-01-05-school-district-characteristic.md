<p><p>The National Center for Education Statisticsâ€™ (NCES) Common
Core of Data (CCD) program is an annual collection of basic administrative
characteristics for all public schools, school districts, and state education
agencies in the United States. These characteristics are reported by state
education officials and include directory information, number of students,
number of teachers, grade span, and other conditions. The NCES Education
Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated
school district boundary composite files that include public elementary,
secondary, and unified school district boundaries clipped to the U.S.
shoreline. School districts are special-purpose administrative units designed
by state and local officials to provide public education for local residents.
District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to develop
demographic estimates and to support educational research and program
administration. The administrative attributes in this layer were developed from
the 2017-2018 CCD collection. For more information about NCES school district
boundaries, see: <a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries' rel='nofollow ugc'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries</a>.
