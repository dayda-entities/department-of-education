CSPR 2009-10 (https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/consolidated/sy09-10part1/index.html; https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/consolidated/sy09-10part2/index.html) is a cross-sectional report that measures each state's progress towards implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and the reporting instrument for state formula grant programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by NCLB. The reporting was conducted using state education agencies' (SEAs) reports in the EDFacts online submission system. CSPR 2009-10 is a universe survey. The study's response rate was 100%.  Key statistics include information on adequate yearly progress, state performance assessments, highly qualified teachers, public school choice and supplemental education services options.
