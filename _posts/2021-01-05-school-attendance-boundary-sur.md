<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span><span>The School Attendance Boundaries Survey (SABS) was an experimental survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s (ED) National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) with assistance from the U.S. Census Bureau to collect school attendance boundaries for regular schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Attendance boundaries, sometimes known as school catchment areas, define the geographic extent served by a local school for the purpose of student assignments. School district administrators create attendance areas to help organize and plan district-wide services, and districts may adjust individual school boundaries to help balance the physical capacity of local schools with changes in the local school-age population. The SABS collection includes boundaries for more than 70,000 schools in over 12,000 school districts throughout the U.S.</span></span></p><p></div></div></div></p>
