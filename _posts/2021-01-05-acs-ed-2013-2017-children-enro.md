The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' rel='nofollow ugc' style='color: rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line: none; font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;' target='_blank'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a>
