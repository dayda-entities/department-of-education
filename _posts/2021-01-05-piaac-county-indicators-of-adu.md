<p style='background:white;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt; color:black; background:white;'>The National
Center for Education Statistics surveyed <b>12,330 U.S. adults</b> ages
16 to 74 living in households from 2012 to 2017 for the Program for the
International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), an international study
involving over 35 countries. Using small area estimation models (SAE), indirect
estimates of literacy and numeracy proficiency have been produced for all U.S.
states and counties. By using PIAAC survey data in conjunction with data from
the American Community Survey, the Skills Map data provides reliable estimates
of adult literacy and numeracy skills in all <b>50 states</b>, all <b>3,141
counties</b>, and the District of Columbia.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt; color:black; background:white;'>SAE is a model-dependent approach that produces indirect
estimates for areas where survey data is inadequate for direct estimation. SAE
models assume that counties with similar demographics would have similar
estimates of skills. An estimate for a county then “borrows strength” across
related small areas through auxiliary information to produce reliable indirect
estimates for small areas. The models rely on covariates available at the small
areas, and PIAAC survey data. In the absence of any other proficiency
assessment data for individual states and counties, the estimates provide a
general picture of proficiency for all states and counties. In addition to the
indirect estimates, this website provides precision estimates and facilitates
statistical comparisons among states and counties. For technical details on the
SAE approach applied to PIAAC, see section 5 of the State and County Estimation
Methodology Report.</span></p>

<p style='background:white;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt; color:black;'>The U.S. county indirect estimates
reported in this data are not directly comparable with the direct estimates for
PIAAC countries that are reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD). Specifically, the U.S. county indirect estimates (1)
represent modeled estimates for adults ages 16-74 whereas the OECD’s direct
estimates for participating countries represent estimates for adults ages
16-65, (2) include data for “literacy-related nonresponse” (i.e., adults whose
English language skills were too low to participate in the study) whereas the
OECD’s direct estimates for countries exclude these data, and (3) are based on
three combined data collections (2012/2014/2017) whereas OECD’s direct
estimates are based on a single data collection.</span></p><p style='background:white;'><font size='3'><font color='#000000'>Please visit the</font> <a href='https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Skills Map</a> t<font color='#000000'>o learn more about this data.</font></font><span style='font-size:12.0pt; color:black;'><br /></span></p>
