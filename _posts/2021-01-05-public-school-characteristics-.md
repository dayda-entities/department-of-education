<div style='text-align:Left;'><p><p>The National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Common
Core of Data (CCD) program is an annual collection of basic administrative
characteristics for all public schools, school districts, and state education
agencies in the United States. These characteristics are reported by state
education officials and include directory information, number of students,
number of teachers, grade span, and other conditions. The NCES Education
Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated
point locations (latitude and longitude) for public elementary and secondary
schools included in the CCD. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE)
Branch to develop point locations for schools and school district
administrative offices based on reported physical addresses. The point
locations in this data layer were developed from the 2017-2018 CCD collection.
