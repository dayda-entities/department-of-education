<p>The National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES)
Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually
updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for public elementary and
secondary schools included in the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). The CCD is an
annual collection of basic administrative characteristics that includes the
physical address for all public schools, school districts, and state education
agencies in the United States. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S.
Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics
(EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools and school district
administrative offices based on these addresses. The point locations in this
data layer were developed from the 2018-2019 CCD collection. For more
