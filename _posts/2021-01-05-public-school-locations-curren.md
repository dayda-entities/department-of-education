<div style='text-align:Left;'><p>The National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for public elementary and secondary schools included in the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). The CCD is an annual collection of basic administrative characteristics that includes the physical address for all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools and school district administrative offices based on these addresses. The point locations in this data layer represent the most current CCD collection available. Check the SURVYEAR attribute in the data table to determine file vintage.
