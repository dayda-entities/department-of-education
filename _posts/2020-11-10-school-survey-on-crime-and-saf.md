The School Survey on Crime and Safety, 2000 (SSOCS:2000), is a study that is part of the School Survey on Crime and Safety's program; program data is available since 2000 at <https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs/data_products.asp>. SSOCS:2000 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs/) is a cross-sectional survey of the nation's public schools designed to provide estimates of school crime, discipline, disorder, programs and policies. SSOCS is administered to public primary, middle, high, and combined school principals in the spring of even-numbered school years. The study was conducted using a questionnaire and telephone follow-ups of school principals. Public schools were sampled in the spring of 2000 to participate in the study. The studyï¿½s response rate was 70 percent.  A number of key statistics on a variety of topics can be produced with SSOCS data.
