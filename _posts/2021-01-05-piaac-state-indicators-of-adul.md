Statistics surveyed <b>12,330 U.S. adults</b> ages 16 to 74 living in
households from 2012 to 2017 for the Program for the International Assessment
of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), an international study involving over 35
countries. Using small area estimation models (SAE), indirect estimates of
literacy and numeracy proficiency have been produced for all U.S. states and
counties. By using PIAAC survey data in conjunction with data from the American
Community Survey, the Skills Map data provides reliable estimates of adult
literacy and numeracy skills in all <b>50 states</b>, all <b>3,141
counties</b>, and the District of Columbia.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></font></p>

this data were created using a sophisticated statistical method generally
referred to as small area estimation (SAE). SAE is a model-dependent approach
that produces indirect estimates for areas where survey data is inadequate for
direct estimation. SAE models assume that counties with similar demographics
would have similar estimates of skills. An estimate for a county then “borrows
strength” across related small areas through auxiliary information to produce
reliable indirect estimates for small areas. The models rely on covariates
available at the small areas, and PIAAC survey data. In the absence of any
other proficiency assessment data for individual states and counties, the
estimates provide a general picture of proficiency for all states and counties.
For technical details on the SAE approach applied to PIAAC, see section 5 of
the <a href='https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2020225' rel='nofollow ugc' style='box-sizing:border-box;' target='_blank'>State
and County Estimation Methodology Report</a>.</font></span></p>

U.S. state indirect estimates reported in this data are not directly comparable
with the direct estimates for PIAAC countries that are reported by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Specifically, the
U.S. state indirect estimates (1) represent modeled estimates for adults ages
16-74 whereas the OECD’s direct estimates for participating countries represent
estimates for adults ages 16-65, (2) include data for “literacy-related
nonresponse” (i.e., adults whose English language skills were too low to
participate in the study) whereas the OECD’s direct estimates for countries
exclude these data, and (3) are based on three combined data collections
(2012/2014/2017) whereas OECD’s direct estimates are based on a single data
collection.</font></span></p><font color='#000000' size='3'>Please visit the <a href='https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Skills Map</a> to learn more about this data.</font><p></p></div>
