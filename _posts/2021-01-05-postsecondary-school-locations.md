<div style='text-align:Left;'><p>The National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated point locations <span style='background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial;'>(latitude and longitude) </span>for postsecondary institutions included in the NCES <span style='background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial;'>Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)</span>. The IPEDS program annually collects information about enrollments, program completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid from every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended).  The NCES EDGE program uses address information reported in the annually updated IPEDS directory file and collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for all institutions reported in IPEDS. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2016-2017 IPEDS collection.
