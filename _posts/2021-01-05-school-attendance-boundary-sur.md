These data were collected and processed as part of the School Attendance Boundary Survey (SABS) project which was funded by NCES to create geography delineating school attendance boundaries.

The web application provided instructions and assistance to users via a user guide, a frequently asked questions document, and instructional videos. Boundaries supplied outside of the online reporting system typically fell into one of six categories: a digital geographic file, such as a shapefile or KML file; digital image files, such as jpegs and pdfs; narrative descriptions; an interactive web map; Excel or pdf address lists; and paper maps. 2</span><span style='font-family: inherit;'>015 TIGER/line features (that consist of streets, hydrography, railways, etc.) were used to digitize school attendance boundaries and was the primary source of information used to digitize analog information. This practice works well as most school attendance boundaries align with streets, railways, water bodies and similar line features included in the 2015 TIGER/line &quot;edges&quot; files. In those few cases in which a portion of a school attendance boundary serves both sides of a street contractor staff used Esriâ€™s Imagery base map to estimate the property lines of parcels. The data digitized from analog maps and verbal descriptions do not conform to cadastral data (and many of the original GIS files created by school districts do not conform with cadastral or parcel data).</span></p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><span style='font-family: inherit;'>The SABS 2015-2016 file uses the WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere coordinate system.</span></p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>Additional information about SABS can be found on the <a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/SABS' rel='nofollow ugc' style='color: rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line: none; font-family: inherit;' target='_blank'>EDGE website</a>.</p></div>
