Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually
updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for postsecondary institutions
included in the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).
The IPEDS program annually collects information about enrollments, program
completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional
prices, and student financial aid from every college, university, and technical
and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid
programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended). The NCES EDGE
program uses address information reported in the annually updated IPEDS
directory file and collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education
Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point
locations for all institutions reported in IPEDS. The point locations in this
data layer represent the most current IPEDS collection available. Check the
SURVYEAR attribute in the data table to determine file vintage. For more
