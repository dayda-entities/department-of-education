<div style='text-align:Left;'><p style='margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;'>This data layer produced by the National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program provides a geographic locale framework that classifies all U.S. territory into twelve categories ranging from Large Cities to Remote Rural areas. NCES uses this framework to describe the type of geographic area where schools and school districts are located. The criteria for these classifications are defined by NCES, but they rely on standard geographic areas developed and maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2019 NCES Locale boundaries are based on geographic areas represented in Census TIGER/Line 2019. The NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to annually update the locale boundaries. For more information about the NCES locale framework, and to download the data, see: <a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/LocaleBoundaries' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/LocaleBoundaries</a>.
