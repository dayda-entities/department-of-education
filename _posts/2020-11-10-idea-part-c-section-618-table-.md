IDEA Part C Section 618 Table 1 Child Count, 2012 (IDEA Part C Table 1 2012), is a study that is part of the IDEA Part C program; program data is available since 2006 at <https://www2.ed.gov/programs/osepidea/618-data/state-level-data-files/index.html>. IDEA Part C Table 1 2012 is a cross-sectional universe report that collected counts of infants and toddlers with disabilities in each state who (a) are served under IDEA Part C, (b) are served in different program settings, and (c) exit Part C because of program completion or for other reasons. States submitted the report in spreadsheet form by mail or electronically by e-mail. Key statistics produced from IDEA Part C Table 1 2012 provide insights on the demographics of children served under IDEA Part C, service settings, referral to preschool or other services, and personnel providing early intervention services.
