The PSS is conducted to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, teachers, and students, and to build an accurate and complete list of private schools to serve as a sampling frame for NCES surveys. The PSS school location and associated geographic area assignments are derived from reported information about the physical location of private schools. The school geocode file includes supplemental geographic information for the universe of schools reported in the most current PSS school sample, and they can be integrated with the survey files through use of institutional identifiers included in both sources. </span><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Check the SCHOOLYEAR attribute in the data table to determine file vintage. </span><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>For more information about NCES school point data, see: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/SchoolLocations' rel='nofollow ugc' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/SchoolLocations</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'> and </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/LocaleBoundaries' rel='nofollow ugc' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/LocaleBoundaries</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>.</span></p><p><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Previous collections are available for the following year:</span></p><p></p><ul><li><a href='https://nces.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=528953aa81b24f6f8ec071302c550401' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>2015-16</a><br /></li></ul><p></p></div>
