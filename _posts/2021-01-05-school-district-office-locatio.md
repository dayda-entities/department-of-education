<div style='text-align:Left;'><p>The <span style='background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial;'>National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) </span>Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for public school district (local education agency) administrative offices included in the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. The CCD program also provides fiscal data about school district revenues and expenditures. <span style='background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial;'>CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. </span>The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for local education agency (LEA) administrative offices reported in the annual CCD directory file. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2015-2016 CCD collection.
