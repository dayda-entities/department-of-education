My Brother's Keeper (MBK) initiative is an interagency effort to improve measurably the expected educational and life outcomes for and address the persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color (including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans). The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.
