Thank you for your interest in the Promise Neighborhoods Program! You can use the tools below to look at general information about the applications. The data is sourced from applications submitted for the program. Inclusion of an application in the data that follows does not ensure that the application will be considered eligible for an award, or that the application will be funded by the Department of Education. The Absolute Priority assignments do not conclusively indicate that the applicants are eligible to apply under those absolute priorities according to the Department's criteria. Inclusion of an application in this summary information is not an endorsement of an organization, idea, program, or product, and the Department does not validate or guarantee the accuracy of this information. The data are provided in this summary solely for the convenience of the public.
