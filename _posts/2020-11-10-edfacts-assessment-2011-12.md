EDFacts Assessment, 2011–12 (EDFacts ASSMT:2011–12) is one of 17 'topics' identified in the EDFacts documentation (in this database, each 'topic' is entered as a separate study). EDFacts ASSMT:2011–12 (ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts) annually collects cross-sectional data from states about students participation in and performance on academic assessments in Reading/Language Arts, Science, and Mathematics in elementary and secondary education at the school, LEA, and SEA levels. EDFacts ASSMT:2011–12 data were collected using the EDFacts Submission System (ESS), a centralized portal, and their submission by states is mandatory and required for benefits. Not submitting the required reports by a state constitutes a failure to comply with law and may have consequences for federal funding to the state. Key statistics produced from EDFacts ASSMT:2011–12 are from eight (8) data groups with information on Academic Achievement, Academic Achievement-Flexibility, Assessment Participation, and Assessment Participation-Flexibility in Mathematics and Reading/Language Arts. For the purposes of this system, data groups are referred to as 'variables', as a result of the structure and format of EDFacts data.
