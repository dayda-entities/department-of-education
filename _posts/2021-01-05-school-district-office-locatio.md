<div style='text-align:Left;'><p>The National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for public elementary, secondary, and unified school district administrative offices included in the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). <span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>The CCD is an annual collection of basic administrative characteristics that includes the physical address for all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools and school district administrative offices based on these addresses. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2015-2016 CCD collection.
