<p>The National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated school district boundary composite files that include public elementary, secondary, and unified school district boundaries clipped to the U.S. shoreline. School districts are single-purpose administrative units designed by state and local officials to organize and provide public education for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to support educational research and program administration, and the boundaries are essential for constructing district-level estimates of the number of children in poverty.</p><p>The Census Bureau’s School District Boundary Review program (SDBR) (<a href='https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html' rel='nofollow ugc'>https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html</a>) obtains the boundaries, names, and grade ranges from state officials, and integrates these updates into Census TIGER. Census TIGER boundaries include legal maritime buffers for coastal areas by default, but the NCES composite file removes these buffers to facilitate broader use and cleaner cartographic representation. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop the composite school district files. The inputs for this data layer were developed from Census TIGER/Line 2019 and represent boundaries reported for the 2018-2019 school year.
