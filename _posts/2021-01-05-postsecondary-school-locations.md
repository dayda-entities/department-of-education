The National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for postsecondary institutions included in the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The IPEDS program annually collects information about enrollments, program completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid from every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended). IPEDS school point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau's Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools reported in the annual IPEDS file. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2018-2019 IPEDS collection.
